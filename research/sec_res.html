								<h2>PLanetary Secular Resonances -- </h2>
							</header>

							<p align="left" >  Asteroidal impacts on terrestrial planets may be important for planet habitability. Water must have been delivered to the surface of the Earth, potentially through asteroid impacts
						               	 ( <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000M%26PS...35.1309M/abstract">Morbidelli et al. 2000</a>), even though comet collisions and the interaction between the magma and atmosphere 
								have also been suggested as sources of the planet’s water (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008Icar..194...42G/abstract"> Genda & Ikoma 2008</a>). Our Moon plays an intricate role in the Earth’s 
								habitability by stabilizing the rotation axis of the Earth, preventing weather ex- tremes due to chaotic motion. According to some hypotheses, life itself may have been delivered to Earth by 
								asteroids (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011P%26SS...59.1107H/abstract"> Houtkooper 2011</a>). Important heavy elements needed for the existence of life may have also been delivered by asteroid 
								impacts  (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011Natur.477..195W/abstract"> Willbold, Elliott & Moorbath 2011</a>). The rate of asteroid impacts also can have a significant effect on a planet’s habitability. 
								A high rate of impacts could have led to a highly cratered planet, not hospitable to life. On the other hand, too few impacts could suppress the delivery of essential ele- ments. The evolution of life on Earth shows 
								that the presence of an asteroid belt could be necessary (e.g. through mass extinctions) even for the appearance of complex life and intelligence in an exosolar planetary system.
						              </p>
							<p align="left" > Since Jupiter and Saturn are the largest planets in the Solar system, they are the main driving force for the dynamic evolution of the asteroid belt. In a mean-motion resonance, the ratio of the orbital periods 
								of two objects is an integer ratio  (e.g., <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010apf..book.....A/abstract"> Armitage 2010</a>). Several of the well-known mean-motion resonances in our Solar system are the 
								Kirkwood gaps, which are found within the asteroid belt. Secular resonances arise when the apsidal or nodal precession rates of two objects orbiting a central object are close  (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1987CeMec..40..233Y/abstract"> Yoshikawa 1987</a>).
								The most prevalent secular resonance in our Solar system in the ν6 resonance, which occurs between the apsidal precession of the asteroids and Saturn. The outer edge of the ν6 resonance location sets the inner boundary for
								our asteroid belt, which is approximately located at 2 au. A large fraction of near Earth asteroids originates from the inner main belt rather than the middle or outer belt. Many of these asteroids within the 
								inner main belt are injected in the ν6 resonance and end up reaching Earth-crossing orbits.
							</p>
							<p align="left" >  In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.473..295S/abstract"> Smallwood et al. 2018</a>), we are interested in multiplanet exoplanetary systems in which there has not been violent processes that might have destroyed an asteroid belt 
								and prevented the formation of terres- trial planets early in the lifetime of the system. Specifically, we investigate how the architecture of the Solar system affects asteroid impacts on the Earth.

							<p align="left" > The figure below shows the evolution of the asteroid distribution over a span of 10 million years. The asteroid distribution is located in a system containing Earth, Jupiter, Saturn and a super-Earth (except for the control simulation at top left). Top-left panel: 
								evolution of asteroid distribution without a super-Earth. Top-right panel: evolution of asteroid distribution with a 10 Earth-mass super-Earth located at a semimajor axis of 0.8 au. Bottom-left panel: evolution of asteroid distribution with a 10 Earth-mass super-Earth located at 1.2 au. 
								Bottom-right panel: evolution of asteroid distribution with a 10 Earth-mass super-Earth located at 1.4 au. The system containing a 10 Earth-mass super-Earth located at a semimajor axis of 0.8au appears to have a broader ν6 width than a system with no super-Earth. In contrast, if the super-Earth 
								is located exterior to Earth’s orbit, the ν6 resonance completely disappears.

							<p align="left" > Fig. 5 shows the various asteroid outcomes for a system with no super-Earth (top-left panel), a 10 Earth-mass super-Earth located at a semimajor axis a = 0.8 au (top-right panel), a 
								10 Earth-mass super-Earth located at a = 1.2 au (bottom-left panel) and a 10 Earth-mass super-Earth located at a = 1.4 au (bottom-right panel). The initial semimajor axis of each asteroid is 
								shown as a function of the time of its final outcome. The asteroids which were cleared out are originally located at the resonance locations, because mean-motion and secular resonances operate over the 
								initial semimajor axis of each asteroid, increasing the asteroid’s eccentricity. On the right hand vertical axis, we show the mean-motion resonance locations with Jupiter and the super-Earth. 
								When a super-Earth is located at a = 0.8 au, there is a widening of the ν6 secular resonance, which increases the number of asteroids perturbed on to Earth-colliding orbits. 
								When the super-Earth is placed exterior to Earth’s orbit, there is a substantial decrease in the number of Earth-colliding asteroids. This is due to the ν6 resonance being suppressed.

						              The formation of stable polar dust rings has implications for forming polar planets.
						                From our SPH simulations, these dust rings will have an increased mid-plane dust-to-go ratio, 
						                which may be a favourable environment for the steaming instability to operate.
